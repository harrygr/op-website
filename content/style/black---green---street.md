This week i have gone for layers, keeping it clean all black with green bomber, and some colour popping on my Serena Bute London trousers. Keeping me warm is the Serge DeNimes black wool beanie, and on my feet i am wearing some extremely comfy ankle sock/sneakers from Diesel. To complete the look i have gone for a combination of gold and silver, and rose gold jewellery from Serge DeNimes.
