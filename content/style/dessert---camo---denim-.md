This week i have gone for a military look, with some dessert boots layered over cotton camo sweatpants from H&M. The red hoody from Serge DeNimes pops a bit of colour, layered underneath a denim jacket from Mennace. Then to complete the look i have gone for a combination of gold and silver jewellery from Serge DeNimes.

JACKET - Mennace | JUMPER - Serge DeNimes | JEWELLERY - Serge DeNimes | TROUSERS - H&M | SHOES - Rokit
