This week it's all  about the autumnal tones, and the textured patchwork jumper as my statement piece. Layered on top is a shiny aviator style bomber jacket from FCUK with faux fur collar. AG jeans i love, and with this look i have teamed it up with my blue washed and distressed denim, layered over my tan sneaker boots from Nike. Then to finish the look with some Serge DeNimes jewellery, choosing gold to work with the colour palette.
