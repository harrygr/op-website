This weeks look of the week is laid back and light weight perfect for the warm summer evenings. I never thought i would be one to wear baggy trousers, however these light weight beige trousers from Double Rainbouu have 100% swayed me. They are so comfy, and work perfectly with a clean white tucked in t-shirt. Here i am wearing a really clean linen white tee from Zara, which is only Â£19.99. I have teamed the look up with some brown suede boots from Dr Martens, my favourite feature being the bright popping yellow laces. Then finally finished with some accessories, jewellery from my brand Serge DeNimes, some vintage sunglasses, and a camo fedora from Goorin Bros.
