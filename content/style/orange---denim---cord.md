This week i have gone for distressed denim jeans from Neuw denim, teamed up with some chunky orange knitwear from Zara, and finished with a tanned cord borg jacket from Menace. The trainers are Nike SF Air Force mid hight tops, i am obsessed with these right now. The colour teamed up with the zip detail at the back of the sneakers make them silly beaut. To complete the look i have gone for a combination of gold and silver, and rose gold jewellery from Serge DeNimes.
