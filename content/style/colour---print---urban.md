This week I have combined loud colours, with textures, and layers to create a vibey outlandish urban look.  i have teamed up so some navy velvet trousers from Paige (who also do amazing denim), with a purple distressed hoody from Diesel, and layered for the warmth with a reversible grey and orange patterned bomber that I recently bought in a vintage store in Toronto, Canada. Then i finished the look with some street high top clean beige trainers that i recently bought from Arket in Regent Street, and of course accessorised with some Serge DeNimes jewellery.
