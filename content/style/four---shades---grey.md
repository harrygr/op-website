Having return recently from sunny Capetown, i am feeling inspired by cold and grey London. I have gone for shades of grey, broken up by a textured green oversized jumper. The suede jacket is from Menace, as well as the jumper, and the paint splattered skinny fit jeans from Diesel. The grey suede boots are from Frank Wright, and all jewellery is from Serge DeNimes.
