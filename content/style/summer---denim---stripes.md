Summer is coming, and this week i have gone for a red and white striped tee from Neuw Denim teamed up with a light weight distressed denim jacket from Levis as my statement pieces. And you know i love a double denim, so teamed the jacket up with some distressed at the knees black wash jeans from Neuw Denim. Then to smarted up the look, but keeping to the distressed feel i have gone with some brown suede worked boots from Frank Wright. Then finally to complete the look i have gone for a combination of gold and silver, and rose gold jewellery from Serge DeNimes.
