I really into my tracksuits at the moment, for comfort as well as style. There are a lot of epic 2 set tracks out there at the moment, and it is the perfect laid back outfit teamed up with some sneakers, and some jewellery. This week i have gone for a green zip track from Diesel, with black side panels, and an embroidered black wolf branding. Layered on top of of clean white linen tee from Zara, and then for the warmth i have teamed it up with a red scarf from streetwear brand Vision. For the kicks i have gone for my limited edition Nike high tops. Then to finish the look with some Serge DeNimes jewellery, choosing gold to work with the colour palette.
