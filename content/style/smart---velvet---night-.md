This week i am dressing up in a contem\[porary black tie, but toned down with a black tee, and in place of a boy tie/tie i have gone for a gold medallion necklace from Serge DeNimes. The velvet smoking jacket adds a warm bit of colour to break up the black that runs throughout, as well as adding a bit of texture. the matt black black tie trousers act as a nice contract against the shine of the jacket, then are sandwiched by the velvet slip ons from Dunhill and Bell. All jewellery is from Serge DeNimes. The jacket and trousers are both from House of Fraser. 

Jacket - Turner and Sanderson | TEE - Zara | JEWELLERY - Serge DeNimes | TROUSERS - Kenneth Cole | SHOES - Donhall and Bell
