I am currently obsessed with comfort, and on the constant search for the perfect tracksuit. This week i am wearing this vibey red two piece from Ellesse, layered on top of a very festive Monk neck jumper from a vintage store in Toronto. To finish i have gone with some new camo trainers from Diesel, i have these in a few styles and love them. All jewellery is from Serge DeNimes.
