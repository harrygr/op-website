This week it's all about double demim. Not any ordinary double denim, but tie dye double denim from one of my favourite brands Diesel. 90s vibes teamed up with Serge DeNimes bling, and finished with a clean white linen tee from Zara, and some white military style boots from G Star raw. The to break it up i have teamed it up with a oversized camo scare from Zara also.
