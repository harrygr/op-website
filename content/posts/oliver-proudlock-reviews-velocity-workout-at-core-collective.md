![ollie-proudlock-3](https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ollie-proudlock-3.jpg) Core Collective is a spacious high tech gym near High Street Kensington and Holland Park with multi coloured lighting and lively, thumping music creating a upbeat atmosphere. They break down their workout classes into 4 categories – velocity, resistance, accelerate and power yoga.I tried out the velocity class led by Dom, one of the many experienced and professional trainers. Arriving at 1pm the class only had 4 people therefore we were paired up for the session. **This week's fitness class:** Velocity at Core Collective **What it involves:** Lasting 45 minutes the velocity class is high intensity and high impact testing your stamina, endurance and guaranteed to get you working up a sweat. Based on the idea of athletic interval training each exercise lasts between 20-40 seconds with a 20 second rest period. After one exercise you would move on to another exercise until the end of the circuit. In my case I started off on the jumping blocks for 40 seconds, rest for 20 seconds and moved on to 40 seconds of boxing and so on for 7 sectors. After a gruelling, intense and sweaty workout session all I wanted to do was jump into the shower and refresh myself. The showers are high end and spacious and I felt rejuvenated afterwards. I then ventured upstairs to the CPRESS café to enjoy one of their nutritious protein shakes. It does a wide selection of cold press shakes that you can add protein to making it the perfect drink to replenish and revitalise your body after a full on workout. Those in a rush can pre-order your shake to be ready for the end of your session. ![core1](https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/core1.jpg) **My verdict:** If you’re looking for something that will break up your regular mundane gym workout then this class is perfect for working up a sweat and switching up your routine. I left feeling rejuvenated and reenergized. Plus the Core Collective is commitment free for those worried about being tied into a membership. **Where to try it:** 45 Phillimore Walk, W8 7RZ; [core-collective.co.uk](http://core-collective.co.uk/)
