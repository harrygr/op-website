This weeks look of the week is a combination of pieces from H&M, Sunspel, Serge DeNimes, and G-Star Raw. I have been looking for some nice slim light weight tan chinos for a while now, and these from Sunspel right on the money. Teamed up with the super soft white tee, and then finished with the collarless denim shirt from H&M. I love the green military boots from G-Star Raw that compliment the tan chinos, and blue denim shirt. ![FullSizeRender](https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fullsizerender.jpg?w=2048) ![IMG_4939](https://oliverproudlock.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_4939.jpg?w=1366)
