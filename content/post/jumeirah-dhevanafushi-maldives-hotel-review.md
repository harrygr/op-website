When you think of the Maldives, a few things come to mind: crystal clear turquoise water, wooden huts balancing on stilts in the middle of the ocean, and honeymoons.

Unrivalled luxury, white-as-snow sand beaches, and an amazing underwater world makes the Jumeirah hotel on Dhevanafushi island an obvious choice for a holiday of a lifetime. If you’re looking to switch off from all the stresses of everyday life, with your family or loved one, then this is the place for you.

## Where is it?

The Jumeirah Resort on Dhevanafushi Island is nestled at the south end of the Maldives in the heart of the Indian Ocean.

## Style

Jumeirah Dhevanafushi is stretched across two islands, a luxurious and enchanting hideaway that offers everything you need to get away from it all. The attention to detail throughout the resort is next to none, making the whole experience aesthetically pleasing but also extremely comfortable.

## Facilities

You will find a host of facilities on this little patch of paradise. If you're feeling active, there is a fully equipped overwater gym with an incredible ocean view and plenty of water sports to keep you entertained, from jet skis, diving, snorkeling, water-skiing, and donutting. Then for those who want to relax and unwind there is the Talise Spa. A tranquil hut on stilts, where you can easily escape the not so busy Maldivian life for some extra blissful relaxation. All the normal treatments are available from massages to manicures made ten times better by the glass floors overlooking the crystal clear water and bright shadows of tropical fish. Emma and I had full body massages, and it was incredible to switch off to the sounds of the ocean.

## Food and Drink

There are two dining experiences, one on the main island offering a mix of cuisines, and then a Japanese restaurant on the other. We had fresh juice shots for breakfast, catch of the day for lunch and spicy curries at dinner.  Eating fresh fish every day never gets old - the local reef fish, a tender white fish, soon became my standard order. As well as the a la carte menu, Jumeirah Dhevanafuhsi hosts two or three themed nights a week, with either a barbecue or a local cuisine buffet all washed down with a great wine list and live local music. A great thing to do when you start to miss some holiday nightlife.

## Which room?

At Jumeirah Dhevanafushi, the rooms and surroundings are beyond anywhere else I have ever stayed before. The land villa, enormous in size, fully equipped with all mod-cons, and boasting its own swimming pool and beach, will be sure to tick all boxes. Offering a personal butler, in room catering, free movies and the biggest bath I’ve ever seen, whether you want to relax indoors in the living room, or dive into your swimming pool, this room will have you covered. And as if that’s not enough, the sea villa option has all that (and more) and balances you over the crystal clear water. Again, large in size and fully equipped the sea villa offers a Jacuzzi, infinity pool overlooking the vast ocean and wooden steps into the shallow waters from your very own floating paradise.

The land villas come with enormous baths looking out to sea

## Best for?

Anyone who wants to fully switch off, and treat themselves to a luxurious holiday that involves incredible service, food, weather, and the most beautiful settings then this is the place for you.

## Best time?

We went in August, which was nice but there was quite a bit of rain in between pockets of sunlight. The best time is around January/February. It's not too busy and the weather is perfect.

## Price?

Between $500-$1000 depending upon your package.
